# Open source cross-platform OpenCore profile editor

OpenCore has gradually become popular, and has always wanted to be an open source cross-platform OC configuration file editor, which has finally been achieved. Therefore, it is very easy to configure OC on platforms other than mac, especially win and linux platforms.

This software is based on SampleCustom.plist provided by the latest development version of OC. It is recommended to upgrade OC to the latest development version before using this software.

OC development version can be downloaded here: https://github.com/williambj1/OpenCore-Factory/releases thanks @williambj1!

Unofficial simplified Chinese reference manual: https://github.com/SukkaW/OpenCore-Document-zh_Hans thanks @SukkaW!

The above links have been put into the "resources" menu of the software.

Interpretation (translation) of various functions of the software: Due to time constraints, I apologize for not finishing and typesetting in detail, and suggest that you study the original OC instructions.

## Features include but are not limited to:

* robust plist file bottom reading and writing code to ensure the correctness of data reading and writing

* Multilingual support (at present, Chinese and English interfaces are supported), which automatically recognizes the operating system language and loads the corresponding localized functions according to the language.

* open source, cross-platform (win, mac, linux all provide binary file download)

* Each function option adopts suspension prompt and status bar prompt

* edit Config.plist completely and visually

* Keep up with the latest development version of OpenCore and keep pace with it completely

* mount ESP partition (mac, win) with one click

* module import and export

* Double-click to open the file, drag and drop the file to the software interface to open the file, and open the file history display

* All three platforms use OC's official macserial to generate serial numbers

* the software is written with all key values, which perfectly cooperates with OCvalidate data check of oc

* Software UI adapts to various resolutions, including winpe and linux livecd, etc.
